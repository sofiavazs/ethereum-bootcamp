# Previous Hash

It's time to add one more crucial input to our block's hash calculation: the hash of the previous block in the chain.

## Linking Blocks

This creates a chain where any change to the data of an earlier block will affect each subsequent block.

🔍 Let's take a look at what a change would do in details.

# 🏁 Your Goal: Link Blocks

To link the blocks you have to accomplish two things:

Add a previousHash property to each block. The value of this property should be the hash of the block before it in the chain.
Use this previousHash property in the calculation of the block's hash.

> 💡 Hints

> A good spot to add the previousHash property on the block would be in the addBlock function, where a block is placed on the chain.
> So far, the Block class in your Block.js file does not yet contain a previousHash property and currently only hashes this.data of a block - you must also include the block's this.previousHash property in the toHash function!
> You can add multiple inputs to the SHA256 function by using the + operator, for example:
> `const hash = SHA256("dog" + "cat); // hash of dog and cat together`
