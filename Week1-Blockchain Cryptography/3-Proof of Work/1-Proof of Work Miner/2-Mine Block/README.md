# Mining Blocks

In Bitcoin, blocks contain quite a bit of information in their header: the software version, a timestamp, the merkle root of its transactions, the previous block hash, and the difficulty.

# 🏁 Your Goal: Mine Block

The goal of this stage is to update the `mine()` fuction to create a new block with a unique identifier and add it to our blocks array.

For the purposes of this mining exercise, our block will be an object with a single property: an `id` that is equal to the block height prior to it being mined.

Update the `mine()`function to create a new block object with a single property: id
Set the id property to the block height prior to the new block being added
Push the block object into the blocks array
