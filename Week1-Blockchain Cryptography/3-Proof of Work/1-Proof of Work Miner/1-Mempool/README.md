# The Mempool

Users who want to make transactions will broadcast their transactions to the blockchain network. The mempool is a place for miners to keep those transactions before adding them to a block.

Typically, the miner will take all the transactions with the highest transaction fees from the mempool. Then they'll add them to the block and attempt to find the proof of work.

# 🏁 Your Goal: Add Transaction

Your goal is to implement the `addTransaction` function, which adds transactions to the mempool.

Take the transaction sent to the function and push it on top of the mempool array.
