# Block Size

In Bitcoin, there is a specific block size limit that cannot be exceeded. The number of transactions that will fit inside of a block varies due to transactions being of all different sizes.

For the purposes of this exercise, we will use the `MAX_TRANSACTIONS` constant.

# 🏁 Your Goal: Mine Transactions

Inside the mine function, pull transactions off the mempool and include them in the block in an array called transactions
Remove each transaction you include in the block from the mempool
Add the transactions array to the block before hashing the block
⚠️ Do not include more transactions in the block than the `MAX_TRANSACTIONS` limit.
